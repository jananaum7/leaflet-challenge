## Introduction

This project is an interactive map-based application to visualize earthquake data from the USGS. It uses the Leaflet.js library to display earthquakes around the world, with each earthquake represented as a circle marker sized and colored based on its magnitude and depth. Users can hover over markers for additional information on the earthquake's location, magnitude, and depth.
